This project went through all three stages of development from initial wireframes to design and finally full JAMSTACK build with an integration with contentful headless CMS. Dawn has full control of the content she wants to display to her audience. This project is built within the next.js architecture with incremental static regeneration where the front end is waiting to consume new data that's been sent from the contentful API.
